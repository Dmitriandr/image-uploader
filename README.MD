##Building from source

You need Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 to build Image Uploader. 
Installing Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 is strongly recommended (older versions corrupt .rc files after editing)
If you are using a newer MSVC version, you may experience some compilation errors, which can be solved easily (if you fix these errors, please provide a patch or pull request). 
But also you need to recompile 3rd-party 
libraries (boost, glog, jsoncpp, etc) against your compiler version (so I recommend to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 to avoid all these issues).

You can download ALL necessary libraries and headers (precompiled for MSVC 2013) by following link:
